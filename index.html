        Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a branch of computer science that focuses on 
        creating smart machines capable of performing tasks that normally require 
        human intelligence, such as learning, problem-solving, and decision-making.

    AI also helps students and professionals by providing smart tools like chatbots,
    virtual assistants, and recommendation systems. These tools save time and
    improve productivity.

    In the future, Artificial Intelligence will continue to grow and play an
    important role in solving real-world problems in science, education,
    healthcare, and technology.
